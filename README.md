# Postscript

In the past I thought that postscript was just an old file format, but that one
day I learned that it is turing commplete. This was sufficient to catch my
attention.
This Repo contains some postscript files that I wrote learning the language,
but most of them are just the result of having fun with the language.

## Contents (incomplete)

### Guitar / String instruments

- *Akkorde.eps*
  Finger positions (chords) for guitar beginners.
  Some introductions contain too difficult chords for beginners.
  Some have too many chords, so beginners do not know where to start.
  I teached beginners often, but found no literature or weblink that is good
  enough to just give it away.
  So I made this list of chords on my own.
- *AkkordeBlanko.ps*
  Just a helper to note new guitar finger positions on paper.
- *AlleAkkorde.eps*
  A special notation that I invented to note which finger positions make which
  chord variations. (TODO: Description how to use it)
  Once understood it is easy and fast to use.
  This file can be modified easily to match other string instruments or
  alternative guitar tunings.

### Mandelbrot set:

- Apfelm√§nnchenText.ps
